<!-- In this example, we have a container element with a width and height of 400 pixels and a border. The container has a position: relative; property, which establishes it as the containing block for the absolutely positioned child elements.

Inside the container, we have four box elements with a width and height of 100 pixels and a red background color. These box elements have a position: absolute; property, which takes them out of the normal document flow.

Each box element is positioned using the top, right, bottom, and left properties:

    The top-left box is positioned at the top left corner of the container using top: 0; and left: 0;.
    The top-right box is positioned at the top right corner of the container using top: 0; and right: 0;.
    The bottom-left box is positioned at the bottom left corner of the container using bottom: 0; and left: 0;.
    The bottom-right box is positioned at the bottom right corner of the container using bottom: 0; and right: 0;.


By using different combinations of top, right, bottom, and left properties, we can position elements precisely within their containing block.

When you open this HTML file in a web browser, you will see four boxes positioned at the corners of the container. -->
